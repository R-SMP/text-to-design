After the description, I will ask you to prepare the function call for execution, but don't execute it until I explicitly request it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To implement the user's request using function calls, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create the Main Rectangular Block:**\n   - Use the `block` function to create a rectangular block with dimensions 160.5mm (length in X-axis), 67.5mm (width in Y-axis), and 70mm (height in Z-axis). The basepoint of the block will be at the origin (0,0,0).\n\n2. **Create the Main Counterbore Cylinder:**\n   - Use the `cylinder` function to create the inner cylinder with a diameter of 35mm. The axis of this cylinder is at X=30mm, Z=37.5mm, and it is parallel to the Y-axis, creating a through hole.\n   - Create two additional cylinders at the same axis point (X=30mm, Z=37.5mm) with a diameter of 55mm. These cylinders will penetrate from both surfaces into the part, leaving 7mm of material in the center. Calculate the penetration depth based on the total width of the block and the remaining material.\n\n3. **Apply Force on the Inner Cylinder:**\n   - Use the `force` function to apply a force of 34.155 kN on the inner cylinder. The direction of the force is given by the unit vector (-0.9962, 0, 0.0872).\n\n4. **Create Screw Fixation Holes:**\n   - Use the `cylinder` function to create the first screw fixation hole with a diameter of 10mm. The position is at X=26.75mm, Y=7.5mm, and the axis is in the Z-axis direction with a length of 10mm.\n   - Create four additional holes, each spaced 26.75mm apart in the X-axis direction from the previous hole.\n   - Mirror this pattern of five holes to the other side of the part along the middle axis in the X-axis direction.\n\n5. **Finalize the Geometry:**\n   - Ensure all geometries are correctly connected and aligned.\n\nOnce you confirm, I will prepare the function calls for execution."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Now i want you to execute the prepared function calls one after the other.
