After the description, I will ask you to prepare the function call for execution, but don't execute it until I explicitly request it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To implement the user's request using function calls, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create the Main Rectangular Block:**\n   - Use the `block` function to create a rectangular block with dimensions 160.5mm (length in X-axis), 67.5mm (width in Y-axis), and 70mm (height in Z-axis). Position this block at the origin (0,0,0).\n\n2. **Create the Main Counterbore Cylinder:**\n   - Use the `cylinder` function to create the inner cylinder with a diameter of 35mm. The axis of this cylinder is at X=30mm, Z=37.5mm, and it is parallel to the Y-axis. This cylinder should be a through-hole, so its length should be equal to the width of the block (67.5mm).\n\n3. **Create the Additional Counterbore Cylinders:**\n   - Use the `cylinder` function to create two additional cylinders at the same axis (X=30mm, Z=37.5mm) and parallel to the Y-axis. Each cylinder should have a diameter of 55mm and penetrate from both surfaces into the part, leaving 7mm material in the center. Therefore, each cylinder should have a length of (67.5mm - 7mm)/2 = 30.25mm.\n\n4. **Apply Force on the Inner Cylinder:**\n   - Use the `force` function to apply a force of 34.155 kN on the inner cylinder. The force direction is given by the unit vector (-0.9962, 0, 0.0872).\n\n5. **Create Screw Fixation Holes:**\n   - Use the `cylinder` function to create the first screw fixation hole with a diameter of 10mm, positioned at X=26.75mm, Y=7.5mm, and axis in the Z-axis direction with a length of 10mm.\n   - Create four additional holes, each spaced 26.75mm apart in the X-axis direction from the previous hole.\n   - Mirror this pattern of 5 holes to the other side of the part along the middle axis in the X-axis direction.\n\nBy following these steps, you will create the desired geometry with the specified features and force application.
