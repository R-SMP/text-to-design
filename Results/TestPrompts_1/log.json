After the description, I will ask you to prepare the function call for execution, but don't execute it until I explicitly request it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To implement the user's request using function calls, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create the Rectangular Block:**\n   - Use the `block` function to create a rectangular block with dimensions 160.5mm (length in X-axis), 67.5mm (width in Y-axis), and 70mm (height in Z-axis). The block will be positioned at the origin (0,0,0).\n\n2. **Create the Main Counterbore Cylinder:**\n   - Use the `cylinder` function to create the inner cylinder with a diameter of 35mm. The axis of the cylinder is at X=30mm, Z=37.5mm, and it is parallel to the Y-axis. This cylinder will be a through-hole, so it will penetrate the entire width of the block (67.5mm).\n\n3. **Create the Additional Cylinders:**\n   - Use the `cylinder` function to create two additional cylinders at the same axis (X=30mm, Z=37.5mm) and parallel to the Y-axis. Each cylinder will have a diameter of 55mm and will penetrate from both surfaces into the part, leaving 7mm material in the center. This means each cylinder will have a penetration depth of (67.5mm - 7mm) / 2 = 30.25mm from each surface.\n\n4. **Apply Force on the Inner Cylinder:**\n   - Use the `force` function to apply a force of 34.155 kN on the inner cylinder. The direction of the force is given by the unit vector (-0.9962, 0, 0.0872).\n\n5. **Create the Screw Fixation Holes:**\n   - Use the `cylinder` function to create the first screw fixation hole with a diameter of 10mm. The hole is positioned at X=26.75mm, Y=7.5mm, and the axis is in the Z-axis direction with a length of 10mm.\n   - Create four additional holes, each spaced 26.75mm apart in the X-axis direction from the previous one.\n   - Mirror this pattern of 5 holes to the other side of the part along the middle axis of the part in the X-axis direction. This means the mirrored holes will be positioned symmetrically with respect to the center of the block in the X-axis direction.\n\nOnce you confirm, I will prepare the function calls for execution."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Now i want you to execute the prepared function calls one after the other.
