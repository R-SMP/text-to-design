# text-to-design
We present a novel framework leveraging function calling and agent workflows for automating Computer-Aided Design (CAD) geometry generation. This framework allows LLMs to automatically interpret intricate design requirements from textual prompts and generate the necessary CAD code for design realization. It can be integrated with any recent LLM that can be accessed via API. It offers four distinct agent workflows: zeroShot, stepPlanning, askBack, and visualInspection.
