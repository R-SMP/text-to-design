The block is positioned at the origin (0,0,0).\n\n2. **Create the Main Counterbore Cylinder:**\n   - Use the `cylinder` function to create the inner cylinder with a diameter of 35mm. The axis of this cylinder is at X=30mm, Z=37.5mm, and it is parallel to the Y-axis. This cylinder is a through-hole, so its length should be equal to the width of the block (67.5mm).\n\n3. **Create the Additional Counterbore Cylinders:**\n   - Use the `cylinder` function to create two additional cylinders at the same axis (X=30mm, Z=37.5mm), parallel to the Y-axis, with a diameter of 55mm. Each cylinder penetrates from both surfaces into the part, leaving 7mm material in the center. Therefore, each cylinder should have a length of (67.5mm - 7mm) / 2 = 30.25mm.\n\n4. **Apply Force on the Inner Cylinder:**\n   - Use the `force` function to apply a force of 34.155 kN on the inner cylinder. The force direction is given by the unit vector (-0.9962, 0, 0.0872).\n\n5. **Create the Screw Fixation Holes:**\n   - Use the `cylinder` function to create the first screw fixation hole with a diameter of 10mm, positioned at X=26.75mm, Y=7.5mm, and axis in the Z-axis direction with a length of 10mm.\n   - Create four additional holes, each spaced 26.75mm apart in the X-axis direction from the previous hole.\n   - Mirror this pattern of 5 holes to the other side of the part along the middle axis of the part in the X-axis direction.\n\n6. **Finalize the Geometry:**\n   - Use the `finished` function to indicate that all necessary functions have been called.\n\nOnce you are ready, I will prepare the function calls for execution."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Now i want you to execute the prepared function calls one after the other.
